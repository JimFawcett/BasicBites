# BasicBites
<a href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/Resources/BasicBites/BasicBites_Intro.html">BasicBites</a> are pages that describe basic programming technology, 
e.g., Platforms, Programming, and Object Models. 

Platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
  - Virtual Memory
  - Scheduling
  - I/O
  - System-wide Resources

Programming (C++, Rust, C#)
  - Execution
  - Types
  - Functions
  - Safety
  - Platform API
  - Program Structure

Object Models (C++, Rust, C#)
  - Lifetime
  - Resource Management
  - Ownership

This repository will hold demonstration code for the Programming and Object Model sections of the BasicBites thread.

Contents are under construction, currently consisting of a fairly small part of its intended final state.
